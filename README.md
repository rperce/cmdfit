Terminal workout tracker

Quick shortcuts for logging sets and for timer (both for rests and holds, different timers of course). For example, if I did 8 pushups, pressing S (for set, dunno) would repeat the previous set. Pressing S then up would add 9 instead of 8. Also it’d start the timer for rest.

Have different views, like routine view, but also a view for each different exercise/movement so you can see them progress, and another view with all your workouts so you can compare which is stalling and might need more focus.

Option to have several routines so you can easily switch up between them, useful for split workouts, or having mobility, stretching and strength as separate things.

Another section for goals, notes, general stats.

Exercises are user input, not a stupid database like fitocracy (or at least a database that you can easily modify and add into, but I don’t think this is important), and you could separate them into categories and movements, so you can view all pulls separately, as well as “pullup progression” where you can see your progress go from negatives to Lsit pullups for example.

Also, sexy so it can be shown in r/unixporn
